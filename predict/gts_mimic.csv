54982969	large right pleural effusion with resultant significant collapse of the of the right lung however underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded . there is significant opacification of the right hemi thorax mostly secondary to a large pleural effusion . underlying parenchymal consolidation cannot be excluded . the left lung is well inflated with no focal consolidation . cardiomediastinal silhouette is midline and within normal limits . 
50036637	new right upper lobe airspace opacification which may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema or a developing pneumonia . a right upper extremity picc terminates in the distal superior vena cava . lung volumes are minimally improved . there is an unchanged infiltrative pulmonary abnormality right greater than left consistent with the history of ards . a more focal area of airspace consolidation seen in the right upper lobe is new . cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged . there is no pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion . 
50179434	 widespread multifocal pneumonia worsening on the left . possiblle pulmonary nodules . et tube appears small given the size of the trachea . clinical correlation is recommended . the right internal jugular line ends in satisfactory position with tip in the mid-to-distal svc . enteric tube is in standard position coursing towards the stomach with tip off the film . the et tube is in satisfactory position although the diameter of the et tube is only one-third of the diameter of the trachea . cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable . there is no pneumothorax . bilateral pleural effusions are worsening . extensive air space opacification of the right lung is unchanged . however there is increasing left lung opacification now involving most of the left lung . heterogeneity of the consolidation suggests a nodular component . there is also mild pulmonary edema . 
50909732	multifocal pneumonia relatively unchanged in appearance from prior examination . there is no significant change compared to prior examination with redemonstration of scattered asymmetric right greater than left opacities compatible with multifocal pneumonia . there is a probable small left pleural effusion . there is no pneumothorax . an ng tube remains in appropriate position . a right-sided picc line terminates in the mid svc . 
50976286	little overall change . in comparison with the study of xxx the monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged . diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again seen possibly slightly worse consistent with the clinical diagnosis of ards . the possibility of supervening pneumonia would be very difficult to exclude in the appropriate clinical setting . 
51234619	as compared to the previous radiograph there is no relevant change . extensive predominantly reticular bilateral parenchymal opacities right more than left unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette . indistinct borders of the vessels might suggest minimal fluid overload . lateral apical thickening . unchanged course of the nasogastric tube . no evidence of acute changes .
